### **Lab 01 - Setting up Azure Machine Learning Workspace**

#### **Introduction**
Contoso Bank is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation across all its departments to enhance their operational efficiency and customer engagement. Currently, the bank's customer base is predominantly composed of liability customers (depositors), while the asset customer base (borrowers) is relatively smaller. The bank aims to rapidly expand its asset customer segment to generate additional revenue through loan interests.

In the previous quarter, the bank launched a marketing campaign targeting potential borrowers, which resulted in an average conversion rate in the single digits. As part of its digital transformation strategy, the marketing department seeks to design more effective campaigns that leverage targeted marketing techniques. The goal is to significantly increase the conversion ratio to double digits while maintaining the same budget as the last campaign. This initiative is pivotal for driving growth and maximizing the bank's profitability through increased borrowing activity.

**Lab Objective**

As part of a POC, Contoso bank's marketing team would like to work with the Data Analytics and AI engineering teams who can help them build an app that uses data-driven AI-enhanced strategies to improve campaign targeting, so the marketing team can aim for a double-digit conversion rate of the asset customer base within the same budget.
In this lab, you will work on behalf of Contoso bank's AI engineering team to build this app, which makes use of Azure AI, AML and MLOps to achieve the solution.

**By the end of this lab you will know how-to:**

- Setup Azure Machine Learning workspace

**Tools and Technologies used in this lab :**

1.  **Azure Machine Learning (AML)**: For building, training, and
    deploying the predictive model in the banking scenario.

2.  **MLOps**: For covering model training, deployment, and automated model
    management.

3.  **Azure AI Studio**: Used to create, configure, and deploy the
    chatbot powered by Azure AI and integrated with the AML model.

4.  **Azure AI Search**: For enriching the chatbot with search and query
    capabilities based on customer data and loan details.

5.  **Azure App Service**: To host and manage the deployed web
    application (chat app).

6.  **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing and managing datasets used in
    training and prediction.

7.  **Python SDK**: For interacting with Azure services, building the
    model and working with data pipelines.

# Exercise 1: Setting up Azure Machine Learning Workspace
#### **Introduction:**
In this exercise, we will set up the foundational components of the Azure Machine Learning workspace. This workspace will be the environment where we train, deploy, and manage machine learning models. The tasks involves creating a new Azure Machine Learning resource, configuring the necessary compute resources, and ensuring that all security and access controls are in place. This environment will serve as the backbone for building predictive models and integrating MLOps into Contoso Bankâ€™s marketing strategies. We are also assigning required permissions to the subscription to perform the above tasks and uploading loan guide documents for chatapp to use and respond to customer queries
