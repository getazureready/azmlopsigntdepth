### **Lab 05 -Leveraging Azure AI Search for Personalized Recommendations**

Contoso Bank is undergoing a comprehensive digital transformation across
all its departments to enhance their operational efficiency and customer
engagement. Currently, the bank's customer base is predominantly.
composed of liability customers (depositors), while the asset customer
base (borrowers) is relatively smaller. The bank aims to rapidly expand
its asset customer segment to generate additional revenue through loan
interests.

In the previous quarter, the bank launched a marketing campaign
targeting potential borrowers, which resulted in an average conversion
rate in the single digits. As part of its digital transformation
strategy, the marketing department seeks to design more effective
campaigns that leverage targeted marketing techniques. The goal is to
significantly increase the conversion ratio to double digits while
maintaining the same budget as the last campaign. This initiative is
pivotal for driving growth and maximizing the bank's profitability
through increased borrowing activity.

**Lab Objective**

"As part of a POC, Contoso Bank's marketing team would like to work with the Data Analytics and AI engineering teams who can help them build an app that uses data-driven AI-enhanced strategies to improve campaign targeting, so the marketing team can aim for a double-digit conversion rate of the asset customer base within the same budget.
In this lab, you will work on behalf of Contoso Bank's AI engineering team to build this app, which makes use of Azure AI, AML, and MLOps to achieve the solution."

**At the end of this lab you will know how-to:**

- Use Azure AI Search Services to enrich the chatbot with search
- use Azure AI Bot Service for customer engagement using a chatbot



# Leveraging Azure AI Search for Personalized Recommendations

>**Introduction:** In this task, we will leverage Azure AI Search to power personalized recommendations for customers. Azure AI Search allows us to index and analyze customer data, enabling us to recommend relevant loan products based on individual customer preferences and behaviors. We will integrate this search functionality with Contoso Bankâ€™s existing systems to ensure seamless data flow and accurate recommendations.
